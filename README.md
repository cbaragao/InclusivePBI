<summary> Principle 1: Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. </summary><br />

| Number | Title | Guideline |
| ------ | ----- | --------- |
| 1.1 | Text Alternatives | :link: [Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html) |
| 1.2 | Time-based Media | :link: [Provide alternatives for time-based media.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv.html)|
| 1.3 | Adaptable | :link: [Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation.html) |
| 1.4 | Distinguishable | :link: [Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast.html) |

| 2.1 | Keyboard Accessible | :link: [Make all functionality available from a keyboard.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html) |
| 2.2 | Enough Time | :link: [Provide users enough time to read and use content.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits.html) |
| 2.3 | Seizures | :link: [Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure.html) |
| 2.4 | Navigable | :link: [Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms.html) |

<details>
<summary> Principle 3: Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. </summary>
<br />

| Number | Title | Guideline |

##  Specific Considerations 

### Vestibular Conditions

Kerry Kolosko has a wonderful article on [considerations for people that have vestibular conditions.](https://kerrykolosko.com/drop-the-drop-shadows/)

## Code

### Power Query

I have made a number of [M functions](https://github.com/cbaragao/InclusivePBI/tree/main/PQ) that help deal with colors and consider color blindness.

### DAX

Microsoft MVP Bernat AgullÃ³ RosellÃ³ has some great articles on using DAX and Tabular Editor to deal with colors:
