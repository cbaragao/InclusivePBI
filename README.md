| 1.3 | Adaptable | Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. |
| 1.4 | Distinguishable | Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. |

##  Specific Considerations 

### Vestibular Conditions

Kerry Kolosko has a wonderful article on [considerations for people that have vestibular conditions.](https://kerrykolosko.com/drop-the-drop-shadows/)

## Code

### Power Query

I have made a number of [M functions](https://github.com/cbaragao/InclusivePBI/tree/main/PQ) that help deal with colors and consider color blindness.
